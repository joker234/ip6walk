ip6dnswalk:
	Walks ip6.arpa tree for a given IPv6 prefix
	
	Note:
		Some authoritative DNS servers such as PowerDNS do not implement
		RFC1035 correctly: http://wiki.powerdns.com/trac/ticket/127
		This has the side effect of preventing DNS walking from working.

ip6dnshide:
	Hides empty terminals in an ip6.arpa zone (preventing walking)
	
	Prevents ip6dnswalk from working (unless the secret used to create the
	wildcards is known because then more information that could be used to
	infer NXDOMAIN is available) by causing queries that would have returned
	NXDOMAIN to return NOERROR using some extra records.
	
	Warning:
		If you're thinking of modifying a DNS server to replace NOERROR
		with NXDOMAIN for ip6.arpa zones, please don't as this isn't
		valid behaviour.
		[ This bogus behaviour would completely prevent walking. ]
		
		You can however replace NXDOMAIN with NOERROR. There's no
		requirement to actually have a terminal RR at or below the
		name being queried - NXDOMAIN just asserts that there isn't
		one. Doing this for non-ip6.arpa zones would give no benefit.
		[ This technically valid behaviour would make walking the zone
		impractical. It'd be mislead into thinking all possible IPs
		exist. ]

		For giving me the idea that reverse DNS enumeration (based on my
		existing knowledge that PowerDNS doesn't do NXDOMAIN properly)
		is actually possible.
