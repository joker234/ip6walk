ip6dnswalk:
	Walks ip6.arpa tree for a given IPv6 prefix
	
	Note:
		Some authoritative DNS servers such as PowerDNS do not implement
		RFC1035 correctly: http://wiki.powerdns.com/trac/ticket/127
		This has the side effect of preventing DNS walking from working.

ip6dnshide:
	Hides empty terminals in an ip6.arpa zone (preventing walking)
	
	Prevents ip6dnswalk from working (unless the secret used to create the
	wildcards is known because then more information that could be used to
	infer NXDOMAIN is available).
